Model Evaluation: Gradient Boosting Regressor

In my data science project, I implemented a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict housing prices. The model's performance was evaluated using three key metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average absolute difference between the predicted prices and the actual prices. The MAE for the model was approximately 1,893,690.55. This means that, on average, the model's predictions had an absolute error of about 1,893,690.55 units of the housing price.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual prices. In this case, the MSE was approximately 23,335,871,384,152.13. MSE tends to give more weight to larger errors.

R-squared (R2): R-squared is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in housing prices. The R-squared value was approximately 0.6299, indicating that the model explained approximately 62.99% of the variance in housing prices. A higher R-squared value is generally desirable, as it suggests a better fit for the data.

In interpreting these results, it's important to note that while the model captures a significant portion of the price variability, there is still room for improvement, particularly in reducing prediction errors.

This model evaluation provides valuable insights into the model's performance and its potential for further refinement. It serves as a critical step in assessing the effectiveness of the Gradient Boosting Regressor in predicting housing prices.
